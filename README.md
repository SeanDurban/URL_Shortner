# URL_Shortner

Both front-end and back-end of a simple url shortener.

This was completed in a timed fashion as a challenge. The solution is functional for the main use cases but is basic. Other additions would increase the quality of the solutions such as testing, error handling, refactoring code, implementing better practices etc. Better validation of parameters and increased security to prevent attacks.

(Realised when it was too late but Shortener*)
